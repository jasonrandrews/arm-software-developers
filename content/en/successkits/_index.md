[Arm Success Kits](https://www.arm.com/products/development-tools/success-kits) are a smart way to access licensed tools and models for both hardware and software development. Each user has unlimited access to all the licensed tools and models they need for maximum productivity. 

Success Kits keep track of the number of users, not individual tool usage. To purchase Arm Success Kits you will need to know how many users will want to use Arm tools.

Success Kits are available as

  - **Software Success Kits (SSK)**: includes all of the software development tools provided by Arm.
  - **Hardware Success Kits (HSK)**: includes SSK as well as additional tools for IP configuration and evaluation.

Software Success Kits contain all of the tools Arm provides for developing and running code for your target

- [Arm Development Studio](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Development%20Studio)
  + includes [Arm Compiler for Embedded](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Compiler%20for%20Embedded) and [Arm Compiler for Embedded FuSa](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Compiler%20for%20Embedded%20FuSa)
- [Keil Microcontroller Development Kit](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Keil%20MDK) Professional Edition
- [Arm Fast Models](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Fast%20Models) run-time license
- [Arm Mobile Studio](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Mobile%20Studio) Professional Edition
- [Arm Allinea Studio](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Allinea%20Studio)

Hardware Success Kits are a super-set of Software Success Kits, adding tools for enabling architecture exploration, IP configuration, and system debug

- [Socrates](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Socrates)
- [AMBA Viz](https://developer.arm.com/Architectures/AMBA#Tools-and-Software)
- [Arm Fast Models](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Fast%20Models)
- Plus all SSK components

[Arm Flexible Access](/afa) is another way to obtain Arm Success Kits. AFA provides s a number of HSK and SSK licenses, depending on your membership tier. Additional licenses can also be purchased as needed.

## Software development tools {#SDT}

The Software Success Kit contains 4 distinct suites of tools for software development. Each suite contains appropriate tools for a particular use case.

### Arm Development Studio

This is the most comprehensive embedded software development suite, supporting all Arm processors within the Arm Flexible Access program. It contains the industry leading Arm Compiler for Embedded, as well as a license for the Arm Compiler for Embedded FuSa (installed separately) for developers working in safety critical segments. This powerful tool can debug, trace, and profile the most advanced multi-core systems. Development Studio is hosted on Windows and Linux platforms.

### Keil Microcontroller Development Kit (MDK)

Keil MDK is a toolchain for developers working with Cortex-M microcontrollers. It is also provided with Arm Compiler for Embedded and enables Arm Compiler for Embedded FuSa. Designed around the CMSIS industry standard, it supports 9500+ microcontrollers. MDK is hosted on Windows platforms only.

### Arm Mobile Studio

Arm Mobile Studio is a suite of performance analysis tools that analyze the CPU activity, GPU activity and content metrics of your game as it runs on a non-rooted Android device. The Professional Edition enables users to integrate into a continuous integration (CI) development flow.

### Arm Allinea Studio

Arm Allinea Studio is a suite of tools for developing server and HPC applications on Arm-based platforms. It contains Arm-specific compilers (C/C++/Fortran) and libraries, plus debug and optimization tools.

## Fast Models {#fasstmodels}

Fast Models are accurate, flexible programmer's view models of Arm IP, allowing you to develop software such as drivers, firmware, OS and applications prior to silicon availability. Arm provides a selection of pre-built systems (Fixed Virtual Platforms (FVP)), as well as tooling (System Canvas) to enable you to build your own virtual platform, enabling software development prior to hardware availability.

The **SSK** license provides run-time licenses for Fast Models, enabling users with such a license to use the FVP or your own platform. The **HSK** license provides this capability as well as the ability to design and build your own platform.

## Hardware development tools {#HDT}

In addition to all the above, the HSK provides tooling for IP configuration and debug.

### Socrates

The Socrates IP Tooling platform is an environment for exploring, configuring, and building Arm IP ready for integration into a System on Chip (SoC).

### AMBA Viz

AMBA Viz is a visualization application for viewing and interacting with hardware events and messages between components within a system, enabling faster, more intuitive debug capability.
