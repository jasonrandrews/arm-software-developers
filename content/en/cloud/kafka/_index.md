    Learning path on how to setup a 3 node Kafka cluster, configure Zookeeper, and run a quick test to verify how to write/read events into the cluster
---

## Learning Objectives 

By the end of this learning path, you will be able to:

* Install Zookeeper and Kafka
* Configure Zookeeper to work with Kafka, configure Kafka, and test that we can write/read events into the Kafka cluster

## Prerequisites

* 7 Physical machines or 7 cloud nodes with Ubuntu/Debian installed. We need 3 Kafka nodes, 3 Zookeeper nodes, and 1 client node.
